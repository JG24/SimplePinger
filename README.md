# SimplePinger
Bash SimplePinger with CSV support

A very simple pinger that can save network errors to a CSV file.

Usage:
- start screen
- run the script: ./SimplePinger
- Ctrl-a + Ctrl-d and wait

The script will create a network_log.csv file and store the date and time when the ping does not receive a response.
